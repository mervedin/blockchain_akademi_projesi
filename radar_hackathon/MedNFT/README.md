# MedNFT Project

## Overview
MedNFT is a blockchain-based platform that allows individuals to securely sell their health data, such as radiology reports and images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs), while maintaining their anonymity. The data will be validated, transformed into NFTs, and made available for purchase.

## Steps for Development

### 1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install Rust and Solana CLI:
     ```bash
     sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://get.rustup.rs)"
     sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.3/install)"
     ```
   - Configure your Solana CLI:
     ```bash
     solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
     ```

### 2. **Create the Smart Contract**
   - Create a new Solana program:
     ```bash
     cargo new --lib med_nft
     cd med_nft
     ```
   - Implement the core logic for handling health data uploads, validation, and NFT minting in `lib.rs`.

### 3. **Define Data Structure**
   - Create data structures to hold health data metadata, including:
     - Hash of the radiology image
     - Anonymized report data
     - Wallet address for payment
     - Validator approval status

### 4. **Implement Validation Mechanism**
   - Create a function for validating uploaded data:
     - Check metadata for authenticity
     - Remove personal information
     - Seek approval from validators

### 5. **Integrate NFT Minting**
   - Use Metaplex or another library to mint NFTs:
     - Link the validated health data to the NFT
     - Ensure that the NFT only reveals the image after purchase

### 6. **Create Frontend Interface**
   - Develop a web interface where users can:
     - Upload their health data
     - Specify their wallet address
     - View available NFTs and their details
   - Use React or another framework for the frontend.

### 7. **Implement AI Integration**
   - Integrate AI to generate summaries for the uploaded reports:
     - Use a machine learning model to provide insights based on the data.

### 8. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test the smart contract:
     - Simulate data uploads and NFT minting
     - Validate security measures against data theft

### 9. **Deploy the Application**
   - Deploy the smart contract on the Solana Devnet or Testnet:
     ```bash
     solana program deploy path/to/your/compiled/program.so
     ```

### 10. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Monitor transactions and user interactions on the platform.
   - Update the smart contract and frontend as necessary based on user feedback and technological improvements.

## Conclusion
MedNFT aims to create a secure marketplace for health data while preserving user anonymity. By leveraging blockchain technology and AI, we can ensure the authenticity and value of health data.
